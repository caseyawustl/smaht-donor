SMaHT hopes that families everywhere will benefit from the project’s genetic discoveries, ultimately leading to new, life-saving treatments and disease prevention. Past genetic research has under-represented some groups, including racial and ethnic minorities. That under-representation can limit what populations benefit from genetic research findings. The SMaHT ELSI project is trying to address these past gaps using a unique approach called Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 360⁰. Using this model, the ELSI team will work with many community stakeholders and create Community Advisory Boards (CABs) to help support diverse donor families as they decide whether or not to donate their loved one’s tissues to SMaHT.
