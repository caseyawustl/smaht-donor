NIH-approved researchers from academic, government, and commercial organizations worldwide may request access to the tissue samples and medical information about the donor. However, we will do everything we can to make sure that the medical information we share will not allow researchers to identify who the donors are. We will never share donorsâ€™ names or other information that we know could identify them with researchers using the tissue or data. Researchers will be subject to an approval process and must also sign an agreement to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the donor.
