### Goals

This team of researchers is called the “ELSI” team, which stands for “Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications” of donating for genetic research. The SMaHT ELSI team is led by Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital. The SMaHT ELSI study will gather information from family decision-makers and staff who meet with families to ask about donations. Historically, genomic research has not represented diverse donors, which has limited the impact of genomic research. The ELSI team will also try to learn more about how to support all families who have lost a loved one and must decide whether or not to donate their loved one’s tissues for research.

### Incorporating Stakeholder Feedback

The Community Advisory Board (CAB) and Multi-Disciplinary Specialty Committee (MDSC) aim to help guide the SMaHT Project at each phase. These stakeholder groups represent key perspectives on issues related to genetic research, including families who have donated their loved one’s tissues for research and professionals who are on the front lines working with families who have lost a loved one. Stakeholder groups can help SMaHT researchers get the necessary tissue samples in the most ethical, gracious way possible for families. Stakeholders will be involved in the SMaHT study throughout all project phases, allowing for direct input on key decisions in a timely and responsive manner. Stakeholders will also inform the SMaHT Project on strategies that may allow for a greater diversity of participants, which may promote equity in the benefits of this project.
